# SixthForm-Python
My python programs in local storage (sadly most of the program's from that time were lost alongside my 
school gmail account) from my time studying computer science in the Streetly academy (2017-2019)

the files named verX.Y.Z are from my year 13 coursework which is a pokemon inspired turn based game. 
It is important to note that this coursework project was also the way in which I learned OO programming and my coding ability
has improved vastly from that 'snapshot'
